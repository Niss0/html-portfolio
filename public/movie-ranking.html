<h1>The Best Movies According to Shahar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
<p>This is one of my top anime-shows. It's not a stand-alone movie, as there are several seasons of this anime before the movie. Therefore it's even better :)</p>
<h3>I Am Legend</h3>
<p>Really cool movie about zombies with Will Smith starring. His acting in thie movie is phenomenal and it's a must watch movie.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>One of the coolest movies i have seen. A ton of incredible actors in this movie. Mind blowing to it's time of release.</p>
